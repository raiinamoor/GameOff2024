...And so, Cain talked to Aunt J. 
There were some hiccups, but after coming clean, Cain showed her the lockbox and she forgave him.
I feel like all of this could have been avoided though, if Cain didn't feel like he had to lie.
Even though he lied to protect himself, it just made things worse.
I'm glad he talked it out with Aunt J, though. Things are looking up!
The End
